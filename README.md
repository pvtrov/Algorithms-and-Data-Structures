# Algorithms and Data Structures
Hello, this is my repo from ASD course on AGH UST.

In [algorithms implementation] you can find implementations of algorithms used to solve various problems. 

In [exercises from course -> labs] you will find solved exercises from my labs.

In exercises from course -> [exams] or [colloquiums] you will find solved problems from tests or exams.

In [exercises from LeetCode] you can see my solutions for [LeetCode] problems.
